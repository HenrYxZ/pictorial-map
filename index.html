					Schehem is the city where Joshua put a stone to commemorate
					that he and the people of Israel committed to follow God.
					The stone can be seen in the same place until today.
					The city is in a high place and in the region of Samaria,
					which is greener.

					Jerusalem is the city where the Temple was built, at the
					top of the mount. To the East there is the Kidron Valley
					which separates the Old City and the Mount of Olives.
					To the South there is the City of David and West of the
					Temple there was the city. Jerusalem is located in the
					region of Judea which is dryer and more desert
				</p>

					The last map is an exploration using real data of the city
					of San Francisco reimagined as in Ancient times.
